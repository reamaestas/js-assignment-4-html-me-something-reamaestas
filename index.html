               <h3>What is SCIENCE?</h3>
               <p>Science is about making observations and asking questions that lead to predictions and data collection. Babies are natural scientists! They see and explore objects by putting them in their mouth. As a baby is exposed to more and more food, they can predict if they will like it or not. And everytime a baby spits out a food they do not like, they are collecting data, and may remember to refuse the food next time.</p>

               <h3>What is TECHNOLOGY?</h3>
               <p>Technology is about using tools. Some may think of technology as sophisticated computers and advanced machines; but one should also consider all of the tools and technology that got us where we are now. Rules, shovels, scissors, scales, and pulleys are all considered technology. Think about the technology used thousands of years ago to build the pyramids!</p>

               <h3>What is ENGINEERING?</h3>
               <p>Engineering is the practice of designing and building, as well as deconstructing and modifying. The word "engineer" comes from the Latin root word "ingenerare," which means "to create." Engineers typically have an idea, problem to solve, or task that requires creativity and patience. They often work on teams with other engineers and scientists to test ideas and designs.</p>

               <h3>What is ART?</h3>
               <p>Art is all about self expression! While paper and pencil, easels and paint, clay and carving tools are very recognizable "art" mediums, let's not forget about language arts which is the study of reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Self expression includes the way you speak and share ideas with the world. The way one designs and creates is a unique respresentation of self expression.</p>

               <p>Math is not just about numbers and operations.</p>

               <h3>What does STEAM look like?</h3>
               <p>STEAM is the thoughtful integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math in a learning experience. This blended learning approach that relies on both process and product. The process requires mapping and working a plan, recording results, anaylzing data, and sharing with peers. The product of this process has tangible touch points that reflect the learning process.</p>
